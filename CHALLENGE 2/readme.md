## NUMBER CHECKER
Number checker is a function that  checks whether exactly two out of the three given integers are positive numbers.
the function takes the three integers as arguments a, b and c.It returns True if exactly two of them are positive, and 
False otherwise

## USAGE
  1.Open your preferred Python IDE or text editor.
  2.Copy and paste the provided function number_checker(a, b, c) into your code.
  3.Call the function with three integers to check if exactly two of them are positive.
  4.print(number_checker(2, 4, -3))  # Output: True
  5.print(number_checker(4, -6, 9))  # Output: True
  6.print(number_checker(-4, 6, 0))  # Output: False

## EXPLANATION
 1.In the first example, the function is called with 2, 4, and -3. Two out of the three numbers (2 and 4) are positive, so the function returns True.
 2.In the second example, the function is called with 4, -6, and 9. Two out of the three numbers (4 and 9) are positive, so the function returns True.
 3.In the third example, the function is called with -4, 6, and 0. Only one number (6) is positive, so the function returns False.
